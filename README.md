## Hi there, I'm Andreas

👨‍💻 I'm currently working as an **Embedded Linux Software Consultant** at **[Siemens](https://github.com/siemens)**, helping business units integrate Linux into their products.

🎓 For my PhD, I researched **Linux-based systems**, particularly how to **tailor** them to their deployment scenarios. My **thesis** [*Automated Tailoring of System Software Stacks*](https://doi.org/10.15488/15610) has now been **published** in the institutional repository of **Leibniz Universität Hannover**.

🐧 My **research tools** are published here as open source software, and working on them has led to multiple contributions to the used libraries.

👨‍🏫 During my years at the **[Chair of Computer Science 4](https://sys.cs.fau.de)** at **[FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.de)**, I enjoyed teaching the exercises for the **[Operating Systems](https://www4.cs.fau.de/Lehre/WS18/V_BS/)** and **[Advanced Operating Systems](https://www4.cs.fau.de/Lehre/SS19/V_BST/)** classes in which students implement their **own operating system** for the x86 architecture, including preemptive scheduling, memory protection and privilege levels.

📄 If you're interested in reading about **my research**, visit my page at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IFs89RIAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao).

🦘 📷 🚀 I love travelling, taking beautiful pictures of interesting places and I'm a huge space nerd.
