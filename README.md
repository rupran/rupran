## Hi there, I'm Andreas

🎓 I research Linux-based systems for my PhD, particularily how to tailor them to their deployment scenarios.

🐧 I publish my research tools as open source software and contribute to the libraries I use.

🧑‍🏫 During my years at the [Chair of Computer Science 4](https://sys.cs.fau.de) at [FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.de), I enjoyed teaching the exercises for the [Operating Systems](https://www4.cs.fau.de/Lehre/WS18/V_BS/) and [Advanced Operating Systems](https://www4.cs.fau.de/Lehre/SS19/V_BST/) classes in which students implement their own operating system for the x86 architecture, including preemptive scheduling, memory protection and privilege levels.

🦘 📷 🚀 I love travelling, taking beautiful pictures of interesting places and I'm a huge space nerd.
